1) Check sufficient speckle
	A) mean(abs(s_BF(:)))/std(abs(s_BF(:)))
	B) num_points in patch / num cells in path (ref)
	C) Plot hist of grayscale image along with Raylight curve
2) Motion between frame in speckle
	A) Create speckle
	B) After or before DA(S) create scatterers (20dB over speckle) and add up DA(S) images
	C) Beamform and track scalloping loss
3) Motion between beams
	A) Find out reasonable maximum speed (max speed heart valve (maybe around 10m/s))
	B) Point lateral shift without speckle
	C) Point lateral shift in speckle
	(Both B) and C): Have a point close to array, one far)

1) Fix plots (window size and plot peak lines)
2) Examine beam-patterns
3) If 2) not good, enhance segmentation and compare points areas to comment on dilation effects
